Hello, my name is Stephen Yan. You can call me Stevie.

I studied computer science and statistics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I specialized in research in mobile systems, made contributions to the Asian American community, and engaged in music education.

I enjoy reading, learning languages, basketball, weightlifting, and I dabble in competitive Super Smash Brothers Melee among other things. Iâ€™m interested in technology, education, and writing. You can find me on LinkedIn, Github, Facebook, and Instagram.

I currently live in New York City.

Feel free to take a look at my resume or contact me.
